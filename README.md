This LaTeX project template adheres to the guidelines of BA Bautzen, specifically tailored for economics. It streamlines the process of creating professional and compliant documents for academic and professional use.

**Use it with your own responsibility.**

## Quickstart LaTeX

- [LaTeX Kurzstart DE](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/de-de/latex-de/)
- [LaTeX Quickstart EN](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/latex/)

## Custom Commands

### Modify Custom Commands

- Custom commands can be changed in `build/commands.sty`.
- Custom layout and package settings can be changed in `build/customization.sty`.

### Available Commands

- `\customtitlepage{path/to/logo.png}{scale}`: Generate a BA Bautzen title page.
- `\customauthorsabstract`: Generate an authors' abstract from the settings.

#### Explanation of the Command `\lawcite`

```latex
\lawcite[ยง 1 Absatz 1 Satz 1]{citation key}
```

- This command is used to cite a specific section of a law.
- `[ยง 164 Absatz 1 Satz 1]` is the optional argument specifying the section, paragraph, or sentence of the law.
- `{citation key}` is the mandatory argument, the citation key from the bibliography.

Ensure that law books are placed in `build/bib/law.bib`. Define the bibliography file in the preamble of your `main.tex` document as follows:

```latex
\addtocategory{law}{aktg1965, .....}
```

### Citing with `\autocite`

Example:

```latex
\autocite[pagenumber]{citation key}
```

## Structure

### Defining Sections and Subsections

Create sections and subsections in the `main.tex` document.

- Create a file in the `sections/` directory named `sectiontitle.tex`.
- Follow the structure provided in `sample.tex`; refer to `introduction.tex` as an example.
- Include this file in your main document using:

  ```latex
  \subfile{sections/introduction}
  ```

Place your images in the `images/` directory.

For changes, look into the `build/` directory.

### Using Attachments

If you need to add attachments in your LaTeX document, use the `attachment` environment. Below is an example:

```latex
\begin{attachment}[NameOfAttachment]
    Write your content here.
\end{attachment}
```

#### List in Attachments

To include lists in the attachments:

```latex
\begin{attachment}[NameOfAttachment2]
    \begin{customlistof}{0cm}{}
        Write list here
    \end{customlistof}
\end{attachment}
```
