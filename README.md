### Explanation of the command `\lawcite`

`\lawcite[ยง 1 Absatz 1 Satz 1]{citation key}`

- This command is used to cite a specific section of a law.
- `[ยง 164 Absatz 1 Satz 1]` is the optional argument, specifying the section, paragraph, or sentence of the law.
- `{citation key}` is the mandatory argument, the citation key from the bibliography.

It is important to place the lawbooks in `build/bib/law.bib`.  
Ensure that you define the bibliography file in the preamble of your `main.tex` document as follows:  
`\addtocategory{law}{aktg1965, .....}`
